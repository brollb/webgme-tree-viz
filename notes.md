# Notes
- [x] create the metamodel for the graph viz
    - graph
        - title/name
    - node
        - children (node)
        - attributes
            - name
            - color

- [ ] lazily load the nodes?
    - it seems the territory depth can probably be inferred from the transformation
    - how should the default transformation work??
        - Can it lazily
    - Can a transformation lazily load nodes on click, too?
        - how exactly would this work?

- [ ] How should we represent transient visualizer state? eg, node status (open/closed)
    - some of these actions
